        <h1 style="color: #00B0FF;">Summary</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I am an Information Systems Engineer/Manager who is on a journey to improve my Front End Developer skills. I provide website and content support to the Voluntary Sector in my spare time and have built a couple of simple web sites for a company, including an eCommerce site. I have used WordPress for these, mainly so I could hand over the content management to the client.
        I am looking to extend the services that  I offer using HTML, CSS and JS and look for a change in career direction.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I enjoy being creative using visual media and I use a well known suite of applications for design, photo editing and publishing.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I am looking forward to this journey, and this online CV will be part of my skills portfolio.</p>

        <h1 style="color: #00B0FF;">Education</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I didn't take a traditional educational route, in fact I missed a whole year at secondary school, but I am a life-long learner. I have successfully completed an array of courses as part of my work, but I have been focussed on operations and not academic qualifications or certifications. I did complete a Foundation Degree (equivalent) however, I did not get to turn this into a formal qualification because the job I was in meant going straight over seas and I didn't find the time to complete the university process. </p>
        
        <h1 style="color: #00B0FF;">Work Experience</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I served in the Military for over 23 years. Scince leaving I have been in IT/IS management related jobs, with the exception of two roles; I was a Postie for a year and also a Continuous/Business Improvement Manager (with IT projects).</p>
